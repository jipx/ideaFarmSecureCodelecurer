The updated chart now includes:

Submission IDs at each point.

Average elapsed time (dashed red line), which is approximately 5.71 minutes.

A clear model annotation: Model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

📉 Average Elapsed Time
Average time between submissions: ~2.42 minutes

This is less than half the average of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (~5.71 min), suggesting faster throughput or burst processing.

## SQS Visibility Window

📌 Notes
Once the timeout expires, the message becomes visible again if it hasn't been deleted — leading to retries.

Setting too short a visibility timeout can result in duplicate processing if Lambda doesn’t finish on time.

Setting too long a timeout can delay retries if something goes wrong (e.g., Lambda crashes).

📊 Key Observations:
🟣 Submission IDs are plotted with alternating labels to reduce overlap.

🟪 Dashed line shows average submission interval: ~1.74 minutes.

🟧 Dotted line at 1.67 minutes marks the new SQS visibility timeout (100 seconds).

🔍 Interpretation:
Your average interval is slightly above the visibility timeout.

This means:

In edge cases, some messages may reappear in the queue before they're successfully deleted.

There's a higher risk of retry/duplicate execution, especially if the Lambda is slow or delayed.

The tight timing suggests that fine-tuning processing time or increasing timeout may help reduce unintended retries.
